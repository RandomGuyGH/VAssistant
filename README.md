# VAssistant
This program generates a virtual assistant that walks around your computer, you can click on it to send commands;

You make it an executable by downloading pyinstaller and using '<filepath> -m pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --add-data "sprites;sprites" archivename.py';

For now this program is only a box that walks and talks to you (speech can be altered in the source main.py file);

To use previous patches, rename the patch file you want to main.py and place it outside the patches folder (and move the updated file to the patches folder)
